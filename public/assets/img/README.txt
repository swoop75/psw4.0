PSW Logo Instructions
===================

Place your logo file here with the name: psw-logo.png

Recommended specifications:
- Format: PNG with transparent background (or SVG)
- Size: 200x200 pixels minimum
- Background: Transparent 
- Style: Simple, clean design that works well in a circle

Supported formats:
- psw-logo.png (recommended)
- psw-logo.svg (also great)
- psw-logo.jpg (if no transparency needed)

The logo will automatically:
- Be displayed in a circular gradient container
- Have beautiful animations and hover effects
- Resize appropriately for different screen sizes
- Fall back to the chart icon if file not found

If the file is not found, the system will automatically show the chart-line icon as a fallback.
