# PSW 4.0 Complete Stock Workflow Analysis

## 📋 Current Workflow Analysis

### ✅ Strengths of Current Design:
- Clear decision tree structure
- Logical flow from ownership perspective
- Handles delisted companies appropriately
- Includes historical data entry (trades/dividends)

### 🔍 Missing Components:

#### 1. **Complete Buy-Sell Cycle**
**Current Gap**: No explicit BUY/SELL actions
**Impact**: Incomplete workflow for actual trading decisions

#### 2. **Portfolio Position Management**
**Current Gap**: No portfolio updates after transactions
**Impact**: Disconnected from actual position tracking

#### 3. **Data Source Integration**
**Current Gap**: No consideration of Börsdata vs Manual company data
**Impact**: Missing critical component of your system

## 🎯 Enhanced Workflow Suggestions

│   │   ├── YES → Monitor for dividends/corporate actions → End
│   │   └── NO → SELL DECISION BRANCH
│   └── NO → Do you want to own it?
│       ├── YES → BUY DECISION BRANCH  
│       └── NO → Do nothing → End
```

### **Scenario B: Transaction-Centric Flow**

```
Start
├── Transaction Type?

│   │   └── NO → Add to manual company data → Execute buy → Update portfolio → End
│   ├── SELL → Execute sell → Update portfolio → Record trade → End
│   └── DIVIDEND → Record dividend → Update portfolio → End
```
