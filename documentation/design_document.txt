PSW: Pengamaskinen Sverige + Worldwide Portfolio Dashboard
Date: 2025-07-07
Version: 4.1

1. Introduction
This document serves as the primary design guideline for the Dividend Stock Portfolio Dashboard, a web-based application designed to visualize and analyze a user's dividend stock portfolio and research individual companies. The goal is to provide a clean, detail-rich, and interactive experience for investment-focused individuals who value precise data and clear visualization, drawing inspiration from the data density and clarity of Nordnet.se and Google Finance.
The dashboard will integrate various API data sources with a MySQL database, running on an Apache server with PHP.

2. Core Design Principles
Inspired by www.avanza.se and Google Finance.

These principles will guide all design decisions:
•	Data Clarity & Precision: Every piece of data presented must be clear, legible, and accurate. Numbers are paramount, and their meaning should be immediately understandable.
•	Information Density with Simplicity: Present a significant amount of data without overwhelming the user. Achieve this through a clean layout, thoughtful use of white space, and logical grouping of related information, akin to Nordnet's balance.
•	Interactivity & Control: Empower users to explore data deeply. Charts and tables must be highly interactive, allowing for filtering, time-frame adjustments, and drill-downs.
•	Actionability: Data should not just be presented; it should facilitate informed decision-making. Key performance indicators and alerts should be prominent.
•	Consistency: Maintain a consistent look, feel, and interaction model across all sections and components of the application.
•	Performance: The dashboard must load quickly and respond smoothly, even with complex data visualizations.

3. Target Audience Profile
Name: The "Detail-Oriented Dividend Investor"
Characteristics:
•	Highly analytical, loves numbers and financial metrics.
•	Focuses primarily on dividends (current yield, historical yield, growth, payout ratio, ex-dividend dates).
•	Values historical data and performance trends.
•	Comfortable navigating data-dense interfaces if well-organized.
•	Seeks clarity, precision, and the ability to "dig deep" into specific company financials.
•	Prefers data presented in both raw numerical format (tables) and digestible visual formats (charts).
•	Needs tools for tracking, analysis, and decision support.
4. Overall Layout & Grid System
The layout will be inspired by the clean, structured approach of Nordnet and Google Finance, prioritizing a clear hierarchy of information.
General Structure:
•	Fixed Header: 
o	Application Logo/Name (Left)
o	Search Bar (Central/Right)
o	User Profile/Settings (Right)
o	Logout Button (Right)
•	Left Sidebar (Optional/Collapsible): For primary navigation between major sections (e.g., Dashboard Summary, Portfolio Details, Company Lookup, News, Settings). This allows for quick access without cluttering the main content area.
•	Main Content Area: Dynamic area displaying the selected dashboard view, company details, or search results. This will be divided into logical sections using a flexible grid system (e.g., 12-column grid for responsiveness).
•	Footer: Minimal, perhaps copyright information or version number.
Key Layout Considerations:
•	Responsive Design: While a desktop-first approach is implied for detailed analysis, the layout should gracefully adapt to smaller screens (tablets) for basic viewing.
•	Information Grouping: Related data points will be grouped visually using cards, panels, or distinct sections with clear headings.
•	White Space: Strategic use of white space to prevent visual clutter and improve readability, especially around data-dense tables and charts.
5. Color Palette & Typography
The palette and typography will aim for a professional, trustworthy, and visually clean aesthetic.
Color Palette:
•	Primary Accent Color: A professional blue or teal (e.g., #007bff or #2196F3 for a Google Finance feel, or a slightly darker Nordnet-like blue #00375E) to highlight interactive elements, calls to action, and key metrics.
•	Secondary Accent Color: A complementary color (e.g., a subtle green for positive performance/growth, a subtle red for negative, or a neutral grey/orange for alerts). 
o	Positive: Green (e.g., #28a745)
o	Negative: Red (e.g., #dc3545)
•	Neutral Palette (Backgrounds & Text): 
o	Backgrounds: Light grey or off-white (e.g., #f8f9fa or #ffffff) for main content areas to provide a clean canvas.
o	Borders/Dividers: Subtle light grey (e.g., #e9ecef).
o	Text: Dark grey/black for primary text (e.g., #212529), lighter grey for secondary text (e.g., #6c757d).
•	Chart Colors: A well-defined set of distinct, accessible colors for data series in charts, ensuring readability and differentiation. Avoid overly bright or clashing colors. 
o	Example Series Colors: Use a professional, muted palette from tools like ColorBrewer (sequential/diverging schemes) or a carefully selected custom set.
Typography:
•	Font Family: A clean, highly readable sans-serif font family. Examples: 
o	Google Fonts: Open Sans, Lato, Roboto (similar to Google Finance).
o	System Fonts: Arial, Helvetica (for broad compatibility).
•	Font Sizes: 
o	Headings (H1, H2, H3): Clear hierarchy, progressively smaller. H1 for main page title, H2 for major section titles, H3 for sub-sections.
o	Body Text: Comfortable reading size (e.g., 14-16px).
o	Data Labels/Table Text: Slightly smaller but still highly legible (e.g., 12-14px).
o	Numbers: Potentially a slightly bolder weight or specific monospaced font for financial figures to improve legibility and alignment in tables.
•	Line Height & Letter Spacing: Optimize for readability, especially in data-dense tables.

8. Technical Considerations (Briefly)
While this is a design document, the following technical aspects are noted as they influence design.
•	Backend: PHP
•	Database: MySQL (phpMyAdmin for management)
•	Web Server: Apache (via XAMPP)
•	Data APIs: Integration with various APIs for real-time stock data, historical financials (Income, Balance, Cash Flow Statements), company facts, and news. Design should account for potential API rate limits or data availability issues.
•	Frontend Technologies: Standard web technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript).
•	Charting Library: Choose a robust JavaScript charting library that supports high interactivity (e.g., Chart.js, D3.js, Highcharts, Echarts). This is crucial for the "time frame change and other ways interact with the chart/data" requirement.
•	TradingView Widget: Direct embedding of the TradingView chart widget will handle its specific UI and interactivity.
•	Responsiveness: Use CSS frameworks or custom CSS media queries for adaptive layouts.
